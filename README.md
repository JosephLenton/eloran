Comics and Ebook reader written in rust.

‚ö†Ô∏è  WORK IN PROGRESS : users and passwords are defined in [sqlite.rs](src/sqlite.rs)

I used [Ubooquity](https://vaemendis.net/ubooquity/) since a few years, but unfortunatly it is not opensource, and there is no read status, so I decided to find another solution.

I tried some alternatives :
- [Komga](https://komga.org) : best project here I think, but no "folder view" üò•
- [Tanoshi](https://github.com/faldez/tanoshi) : works well, in rust too ü¶ÄüöÄ, but no support for ebooks
- [Calibre web](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web) or [BicBucStriim](https://github.com/rvolz/BicBucStriim) : I just can't use Calibre's classification system
- [Kavita](https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita) : nice project too, but I don't like the Collections system (feels like Calibre)
- [Nextcloud epubreader](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/epubreader) : an old app, but it doesn't work with most of my collection

So here I am, a personal project named after my childrens ([Elora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elora_Danan) and [Revan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revan)).

Feel free to use, improve, and cry to my low code quality !

- use a sqlite database
- store ebooks and comcis covers in database (~10ko per cover, almost 160 Mo for 15000 files)
- multiple users, with bookmarks pages, reading status with page number (not for pdf)
- periodic scan of libraries folders
- no cached data, comics images are extracted on the fly
- comics pages responsive size for optimized mobile network usage
- small binary : 5 Mio, alpine based image : 13 Mio
- small css, small compressed svg, no javascript
- rust ü¶ÄüöÄ
